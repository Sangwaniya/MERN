        <p class="text-size-medium">Imagine, teaching the game of chess to a kid. Nearly everyone of us will start by
            explaining the rules regarding pawn, king, queen and other. Trying to get the foundational theory out of the
            way. But the kid on the other hand is looking to have fun and they are just going through a lot of theory
            without actually getting to play the game. <br>‍<br>Now, imagine there is no control on the kid. we will
            need a way to keep the kid engaged without force. What if there is a way to teach what a pawn can do, and
            make them play with only pawns. Tell them how can king can move, and play with two kings on the board. It
            will help in delivering Aha moments and keep the kid engaged.<br></p>
