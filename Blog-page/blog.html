            <h2>With value at each step</h2>
            <p>Imagine, teaching the game of chess to a kid. Nearly everyone of us will start by
                explaining the rules regarding pawn, king, queen and other. Trying to get the foundational theory out of
                the
                way. But the kid on the other hand is looking to have fun and they are just going through a lot of
                theory
                without actually getting to play the game. <br>‚Äç<br>Now, imagine there is no control on the kid. we will
                need a way to keep the kid engaged without force. What if there is a way to teach what a pawn can do,
                and
                make them play with only pawns. Tell them how can king can move, and play with two kings on the board.
                It
                will help in delivering Aha moments and keep the kid engaged.<br>
